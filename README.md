This is a **basic landing page** template featuring a clean and modern design, ideal for showcasing a product, service, or brand. Here’s a breakdown of its main components:

1. **Hero Section**:
   - Positioned at the center of the screen, this hero section serves as the focal point of the page.
   - It includes a bold **headline** (`Welcome to Our Product`) to immediately capture the visitor’s attention.
   - A **subheading paragraph** follows, providing a brief, engaging description to introduce the product or service.
   - The **call-to-action button** (`Get Started`) invites visitors to take further action, such as signing up, exploring features, or contacting the team.

2. **Design & Styling**:
   - The page features a **background gradient** (from deep purple to soft lavender) to create a professional and visually appealing atmosphere.
   - Text is **centered** and styled in a simple, modern font, keeping readability high and the design uncluttered.
   - The **CTA button** has a soft-rounded design with smooth hover effects to encourage interaction. The button changes color slightly on hover, adding a sense of dynamism.

3. **Responsive Adjustments**:
   - The page is optimized for both desktop and mobile displays. The font sizes and button padding adjust on smaller screens to maintain a user-friendly experience.

This template can easily be expanded with additional sections, such as testimonials, feature highlights, or a footer.
